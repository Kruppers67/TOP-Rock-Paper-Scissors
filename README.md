# TOP-Rock-Paper-Scissors
This is my first rework of a javascript project. This project is intended to be played mostly in the console, but allows to prompt the user to get either rock, paper, or scissors. Please see the readme.md file for more info and special comments/links to the live preview.

NOTE: Please open this link via a PC or a laptop! This is not intended for mobile use and is just a sample of code.

ANOTHER NOTE: This beginner game project is played solely in the console and is not intended for any other use. I will have an updated rock paper scissors game connected to a better UI in the future!
